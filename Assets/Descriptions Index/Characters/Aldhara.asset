  description: "With a German Shepherd head and different colored eyes, (I know Aldhara\u2019s
    right eye is brown, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell the color of the left eye)
    there is also a scar on the right eye. \r\n\r\nHe has dark brown areas around
    his eyes, his snout, mouth, and the areas around his ears. The rest of his face
    and his neck is a tan color. \r\n\r\nHe is wearing a cape attached to his outfit.
    On both of his shoulders and near his elbows are bulges. (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s
    part of his armor?) Additionally, he has clothing covering part of his arm and
    part of his hands. \r\n\r\nOn top of his inner clothes are two belts draped diagonally.
    He is wearing a third belt. Attached to the third belt is his sword in a sword
    case which hangs on his left side. \r\n\r\nFrom the lower portions of his chest
    hangs a long rectangular piece of fabric that goes until his knees. \r\n\r\nBoth
    of his knees have these circular coverings. On the side is a circular thing.
    (That\u2019s the best I can do)  \r\n"
